This is the Mini with a relay; the measuring-only [PM Mini Gen3](MiniPMG3.md) is a different device with its own profile. Like the H&T Gen3, the official package keeps its partition table at `0xf000`, so a default ESPHome build does not match.

| Fact | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Profile | `Mini1PMG3` |
| Flash | 8 MB |
| Official package | 2.1.0 (stable since 2026-10-14; Bootloader, partition table and filesystem are the same as in 2.0.1) |
| Partition table | `0xf000` |
| App slot size | `0x2a0000` |
| ESPHome device page | [Shelly 1PM Mini Gen3](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/shelly-1pm-mini-gen3/): pins and an example config |

## Before you start

- [ ] The device runs Shelly's own firmware, not ESPHome yet.
- [ ] You know its IP address (`--ip`), or this PC is connected to the device's own access point (the default, `192.168.33.1`).
- [ ] This PC can be reached from the device: same network, and nothing blocks port 8000 (`--port`).
- [ ] Your ESPHome config uses the partition table below and is compiled.
- [ ] A UART adapter is at hand as your way back ([Recovery over UART](../recovery-uart.md)).

## ESPHome config

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `build` refuses a config without Shelly's partition table. Copy `partitions/Mini1PMG3-stock.csv` from this repository next to your
> YAML and keep `CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET: "0xf000"`.

```yaml
esp32:
  variant: ESP32C3
  board: esp32-c3-devkitm-1
  flash_size: 8MB
  partitions: Mini1PMG3-stock.csv        # copy from partitions/ in this repository
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    sdkconfig_options:
      COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_SIZE: y
      CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET: "0xf000"
    advanced:
      enable_ota_rollback: false

ota:
  - platform: esphome
    allow_partition_access: true
```

> [!TIP]
> The [ESPHome device page](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/shelly-1pm-mini-gen3/) has the pins and an example config. Replace its `esp32:` block with the one above, or `build` refuses it.

## Flash it

1. **Install the requirements** (once):

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Fetch** the official package:

   ```
   python ota.py fetch Mini1PMG3 --insecure
   ```

3. **Build:** put your app into it; the ZIP goes to `out/`:

   ```
   python ota.py build Mini1PMG3 app.ota.bin --esphome-factory app.factory.bin --esphome-yaml app.yaml
   ```

4. **Check the device** first. Nothing is sent:

   ```
   python ota.py send Mini1PMG3 out/Mini1PMG3-app-<date>.zip --ip <device IP> --dry-run
   ```

5. **Flash it** (the log goes to a file with `--log-file`):

   ```
   python ota.py send Mini1PMG3 out/Mini1PMG3-app-<date>.zip --ip <device IP> --log-file
   ```

`app.ota.bin` and `app.factory.bin` are the two files ESPHome compiles. `--dry-run` only checks the device and, for this
package, reads the update target slot. Command reference: [Commands](../commands.md).

## What to expect

`send` shows these lines at the default log level, in this order:

| # | Log line | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `Update target slot: 0 ...` | The slot check of `send`. Anything else: run `python ota.py restore Mini1PMG3` first |
| 2 | `Device: The bootloader will be replaced ...` (raw log: `Boot: cur ... min ... update? 1`) | The installer will write ESPHome's bootloader. `WARNING: The bootloader will NOT be replaced` (`update? 0`) means it will not: build again with a higher `--boot-min-version` ([why](../bootloader-and-slots.md#is-the-new-bootloader-really-written-min_version)) |
| 3 | The progress (`Update: ... %`, one line that updates in place) up to 100 %, then `Done: update installed, the device confirmed it` | The device restarts into ESPHome |

> [!NOTE]
> The package wipes NVS: Wi-Fi and settings are gone. ESPHome opens its own access point or joins the Wi-Fi from your config.
> If nothing comes up, power-cycle the device ([Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md#esphome-does-not-start-after-the-update)).

## Notes for this device

No device-specific findings yet. Please report the file written by `--log-file`, especially the lines `Update target slot`, `Boot: cur ... update?` and `Will write to slot`.

## Way back

`python ota.py restore Mini1PMG3` sends the official firmware back while Shelly firmware still runs.

> [!WARNING]
> Once ESPHome with ESPHome's bootloader is running, `restore` gets no answer and only UART brings Shelly OS back
> ([Recovery over UART](../recovery-uart.md)). Take a flash backup first if you can.
